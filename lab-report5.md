My name is Advait Ramesh, and this is a lab report for Week 10 of Spring 2023 CSE 15L with Joe Politz. The goals of this lab report are to 1) showcase a program with a bug and thoroughly explain the steps to debug the program, and 2) reflect on something interesting I learned in the second half of the quarter of CSE 15L.

Goal 1: Showcasing a Buggy Program

To do this, we're going to simulate a post on EdStem in which a student posts a picture of a symptom of their buggy program and takes a guess at the bug in their program. Then a TA will suggest a step to finding the bug in the program. Then the student will try the suggestion, after which it is clear what the bug is. Here it is:

Student: The arrayInsertFirstMethod() isn't working for me.
