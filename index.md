My name is Advait Ramesh, and this is a lab report for Week 2 of Spring 2023 CSE 15L with Joe Politz. The goal of this report is to describe the steps I took in order to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

Step 1: Installing Visual Studios Code
I did not actually need to install VS Code this time because I had already installed it for CSE 8B. I did numerous PAs on it in that class. Here is a picture of my Visual Studios Code:

This is an image of a programming assignment I did last quarter in CSE 8B using Visual Studios. This shows that I had Visual Studios installed before entering CSE 12.

Step 2: Remotely Connecting
In order to connect my terminal to a computer in the CSE basement, the first thing I did was install Git for Windows, since my computer is on Windows:
