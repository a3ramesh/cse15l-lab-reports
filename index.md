My name is Advait Ramesh, and this is a lab report for Week 2 of Spring 2023 CSE 15L with Joe Politz. The goal of this report is to describe the steps I took in order to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

Step 1: Installing Visual Studios Code

I did not actually need to install VS Code this time because I had already installed it for CSE 8B. I did numerous PAs on it in that class. Here is a picture of my Visual Studios Code:

This is an image of a programming assignment I did last quarter in CSE 8B using Visual Studios. This shows that I had Visual Studios installed before entering CSE 12.

Step 2: Remotely Connecting

In order to connect my terminal to a computer in the CSE basement, the first thing I did was install Git for Windows, since my computer is on Windows:

After I did this, my updated new terminal looked like this:

In this new terminal, I typed the ssh command (which is used to connect to remote servers), followed by my username cs15lsp23sf plus @ieng6.ucsd.edu:

It now asks for my password. After I type it in, the following appears:

With this, my terminal is now connected to a computer in the CSE basement. 

Step 3: Trying Some Commands

I tried multiple commands with this terminal. I tried the ls -lat command:

along with the pwd command and the cat command:
