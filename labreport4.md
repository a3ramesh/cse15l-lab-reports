My name is Advait Ramesh, and this is a lab report for Week 8 of Spring 2023 CSE 15L with Joe Politz. The goal of this lab report is to complete set of steps with the terminal and record the amount of keystrokes each step takes me.

Step 1: Log into ieng6

For this step, I went to the terminal and typed:
ssh cs15lsp23sf@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter> <password> and that's all
  
Step 2: Cloning a fork of the repository from my Github account
In order to clone the directory, I simply type ```git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7```
