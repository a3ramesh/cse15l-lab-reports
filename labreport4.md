My name is Advait Ramesh, and this is a lab report for Week 8 of Spring 2023 CSE 15L with Joe Politz. The goal of this lab report is to complete set of steps with the terminal and record the amount of keystrokes each step takes me.

Step 1: Log into ieng6

For this step, I went to the terminal and typed:
ssh cs15lsp23sf@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter> <password> and that's all
  
Step 2: Cloning a fork of the repository from my Github account
In order to clone the directory, I simply type ```git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7``` However, when I do this, it says the following:

What it says is that the lab7 file already exists in my downloaded files. For the purposes of this assignment, I am going to remove this file so that I can start over again. The way to do this is with the ```rm -rf command```. After executing this command, I should be able to successfully clone a fork of this repository:

Note that I "typed" the git clone command again by using the up arrow a couple of times, since I had just recently typed it. And when I did so, the operation was successful. 
  
Step 3: Running the tests and demonstrating that they fail
